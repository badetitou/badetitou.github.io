A software system project is often composed by several little projects that all toogether are one system.
It is the case for classic frontend/backend apps, and even more when you build [micro-services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) or [micro-frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/).
Considering you, as a company, decided to use git as a versionning system, and you have one git project per project of your final software system.
Since you probably sell several app, you end with thousand of projects, split all over you git management system (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and so on...).
Without a good management of your git managment system, this situation has a grave impact on your business:

- Which git project often fail?
- Is there any projects not tested at all!
- How to ease the onboarding of future employee?  
- Is there useless group (created maybe by an intern, but not use anymore)
- ...

In order to analyze all your git project, I built a new tool named: [*GitProjectHealth*](https://github.com/moosetechnology/GitProjectHealth).
This tool creates a map of your Git management systems and thus help you query it thanks to the power of [Moose](https://modularmoose.org).
