# Privacy information

We do collect data on your username and email for *My Home* application.
These data are and will never be used for any other reason than the proper functioning of the application.

We also store the data about:

- the name of your home in the application: to display it in your view
- The list of grocery: to display it in your view.

Note that, since this application is first made for me to learn Angular, I do not ensure that everything is encrypted and you should not store important data such as password, private information, and so one.

If you need any data to be removed, please send an email and everything will be wipe out
