I spent this year writing my Ph.D., obtaining it, migrating several applications [@Berger-Levrault](https://berger-levrault.com), and... Playing with VSCode and Pharo :joy:

When I started the project of connecting VSCode with Pharo, I wanted language support and basic debugging functions.
Then, I talk to friends, and I decided to implement the support of [Notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook).

Ok... We did more than expected... So, what is the next step?
Why not use the UI of Pharo for specific action I need one developing an app from VSCode?
Or, developing a User Interface app from VSCode and using the gtk backend.

In this post, we will see how to

1. Install the Pharo Language plugin extension in VSCode
2. Configure the plugin
3. Create your first Pharo class in VSCode
4. Create a UI with Spec and GTK
5. Executing it from VSCode
