[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an incredible editor tool.
Thanks to its extension, one can develop using plenty of programming languages.
However, what about analyzing one to understand a software system better?

In this blog post, I will present you how to use VSCode with [Moose](http://moosetechnology.github.io/) to analyze Java code.
As an example, I will reproduce the blog post of [Christopher Fuhrman](https://fuhrmanator.github.io/2019/07/29/AnalyzingJavaWithMoose.html).

> Even if we can perform some analysis from VSCode, using the Moose tool natively gives a better user experience.
> Still, I believe it might interest people using only the VSCode tool.

- [Install VSCode and the Pharo Language Server extension](#install-vscode-and-the-pharo-language-server-extension)
  - [Download an install the required tools](#download-an-install-the-required-tools)
  - [Configure VSCode](#configure-vscode)
- [Clone the Java project you want to analyze](#clone-the-java-project-you-want-to-analyze)

## Install VSCode and the Pharo Language Server extension

### Download an install the required tools

To perform the analysis, we will use the insider version of VSCode.
Currently, only this version supports the [NoteBook feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook) we will use.

So, as a first step, install the last [VSCode insider version](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

We will also need a Moose image and a Pharo VM.
For this blog post, we will use a Moose8 image based on Pharo 8.

- Download the last [Moose 8 image for VSCode](https://github.com/badetitou/Pharo-LanguageServer/releases/download/continuous/Moose64-8.0-PLS.zip) and extract it.
- Download the [corresponding Pharo VM](https://files.pharo.org/get-files/80/) and extract it.

Once you have download VSCode, Moose 8, and the Pharo VM, we will install the extension in VSCode.

- Launch VSCode

In the extension panel, install [`Pharo Language Server`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=badetitou.pharo-language-server).

### Configure VSCode

We now need to configure the Pharo Language Server extension.
To do so:

- go in the VSCode settings (`Ctrl + ,`).
- Search Pharo settings
- Set the field `Path To Image` with the path to the image you have downloaded
- Set the field `Path To VM` with the path to the VM you have downloaded
- Restart VSCode (to be sure the configuration is well saved)

> If you use Windows, you might remove all space characters in the path.

Once the configuration is done, you can create a new file named `oo-analysis.moosebook`.
It should open as a VSCode notebook and a Pharo image (you can reduce the Pharo image, but **do not close it**).

## Clone the Java project you want to analyze

First, we are going to download the GitHub project we want to analyze.
To do so, create a new `code cell` in VSCode with the following code:

```st
javaProjectFileRef := MooseEasyUtility cloneGitHubRepo: 'https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns'.
```

This piece of code will download the project under our Pharo image folder.
To execute the cell, press the run arrow next to the cell.
In case of success, a little tick appears and the path to the clone project has output of the cell.
